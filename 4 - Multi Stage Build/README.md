# Key Concepts: Multi-Stage Builds in Docker

* * *

## ‚ùóProblem:

- When using **Distroless images** for better security and smaller size, you **cannot install dependencies** like `npm`, because tools like `npm` or shell utilities do not exist in distroless images.
    
- You need to **build the app** in one environment (with tools) and **run it** in another (secure, lean).
    

* * *

## üõ† Solution: Multi-Stage Builds

* * *

## **What Are Multi-Stage Builds?**

- Dockerfile can have **multiple `FROM` statements**, each starting a new **stage**.
    
- You can **build in one stage** (with a full-featured base image like Node.js) and then **copy the built app** into a minimal or distroless base image in the next stage.
    

* * *

## üöÄ Benefits:

| Benefit | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Smaller Images | Final image contains only the runtime essentials. |
| Better Security | No compilers, package managers, or shells in the final image. |
| Clear Separation | Clean distinction between build and runtime concerns. |

* * *

## Example: Multi-Stage Dockerfile (for Node.js App)

`npm init -y`

`npm i express@4.19.2 --save-exact`

```Dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build Stage
FROM node:22-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci

# Stage 2: Final Image using Distroless
FROM gcr.io/distroless/nodejs:22
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /app/node_modules node_modules
COPY src src
ENV PORT=3000

CMD ["src/index.js"]
```

* * *

## How it Works:

1.  **Stage 1 (`node:22-alpine`)**:
    
    - Installs dependencies using `npm ci`
        
    - Copies your source code
        
2.  **Stage 2 (Distroless)**:
    
    - Copies the **built app only** from Stage 1.
        
    - No shell, no `npm` ‚Äî just runs the app securely.
        

* * *

## üß™ Build & Run Example

```bash
docker build -t express-multistage .
docker run -p 3000:3000 express-multistage
```

* * *

## üí° Key Point:

You **can‚Äôt use Distroless for building**, only for running.  
Multi-stage builds allow you to **build in one stage** and then **run in a secure, minimal environment**.

# Integrating TypeScript into a Node.js Project with Docker Multi-Stage Builds

## Introduction

This lesson introduces **TypeScript** to a Node.js project, aiming to demonstrate how it affects the **build process** and **Dockerfile**. The focus is on integrating TypeScript with minimal changes and using Docker multi-stage builds to compile TypeScript to JavaScript while still running the app with a **Distroless Node.js image**.

* * *

## 1\. Setting Up TypeScript

### Install TypeScript and Express Types

Install TypeScript and the type definitions for Express as **development dependencies**:

```bash
npm i --save-dev --save-exact typescript@5.3.3 @types/express@4.17.21 
```

### Initialize TypeScript Project

Run the TypeScript initializer to generate a configuration file:

```bash
npx tsc --init
```

### Modify `tsconfig.json`

Specify an output directory for compiled JavaScript:

```json
{
  "outDir": "./dist"
}
```

* * *

## 2\. Converting JavaScript to TypeScript

### Rename and Update Source File

- Rename `index.js` to `index.ts`.
    
- Convert `require` syntax to ES module `import`.
    

#### Before:

```js
const express = require('express');
```

#### After:

```ts
import express from 'express';
```

This change enables **type inference** for Express handlers and removes TypeScript errors.

* * *

## 3\. Build and Run the Application

### Add a Build Script to `package.json`

```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "tsc"
}
```

### Compile TypeScript to JavaScript

```bash
npm run build
```

- Outputs compiled files to the `dist/` directory.
    
- Main output file: `dist/index.js`
    

### Run the Compiled Application

```bash
PORT=3000 node dist/index.js
```

Verify with:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000
# Output: Hello from express
```

* * *

## 4\. Key Notes on Running TypeScript

- Running `index.ts` directly with Node.js will **fail** due to ES module syntax:

```bash
node src/index.ts
# Error: Cannot use import statement outside of a module
```

- Correct approach: **Compile with TypeScript** first, then run the JavaScript output.
    
- Example of valid `.ts` that can run as `.js` directly:
    

```ts
console.log('Hello');  // Can be saved as .ts and run if no TypeScript features are used
```

* * *

## 5\. Summary of Changes Made

- Installed `typescript` and `@types/express`.
    
- Converted `index.js` ‚Üí `index.ts` and updated import syntax.
    
- Created a build script: `npm run build`.
    
- Configured TypeScript to output compiled files in the `dist/` directory.
    
- Demonstrated that **only compiled JavaScript** should be run in production.
